### 🔑 Branch Types

| Branch Name | Description |
|------------|------------|
| `main` | Production-ready code |
| `develop` | Integration branch for development |
| `feature/*` | New feature development |
| `bugfix/*` | Bug fixing |
| `release/*` | Release preparation |
| `hotfix/*` | Critical production fixes |

## 🌳 Branch Rules & Workflow

### 1️⃣ Main Branch (`main`)
- Contains stable production code
- Direct commits are not allowed
- Updated only via Pull Requests

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
feature/user-login
feature/payment-module
git checkout -b feature/user-login develop
